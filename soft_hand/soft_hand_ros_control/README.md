Soft Hand HW using QB software
==============================

1. Ensure you updated the submodule from qbrobotics github: `git submodule update init` if you just cloned the repository

2. Compile as any other catkin package


Setting parameters in the hand board
------------------------------------

For that, you would need to handadmin found in hand-tools/handmoveadmin. Follow the instructions to intall and use.

This could potentially be implemented in the HW interface via services and update the ROS parameters automatically (->ToDo)
